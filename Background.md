Phileurus truncatus, the triceratops beetle, is one of the largest beetle species found in the US. They're a species that live in and around rotting wood and tree stumps. What sets them apart from similar species, such as Odontotaenius disjunctus, the horned passalus/bess beetle, is that they're not exclusively a wood eater their entire lives. The larvae consume fungi and wood, the adults consume meat in the form of worms, other beetle species larvae, and even adult hard-bodied insects! This "project" will document the experience of keeping the adults and all the requirements that come along with it.
