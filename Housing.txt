For a species that is barely understood and would seem impossible to keep in captivity, they sure are one of the easiest insects to keep by far! Seriously, it doesn't get much simpler than this. How simple? Just read below.

## Housing
At minimum, a 12x12x12 inch square container. Recommend something with more walking room as they do ocassionally like to roam around, so something that's over 12 inches in one direction is preferred. Make sure it's well ventilated and has a firm closing lid so the beetle can't escape.

## Substrate
At least 6 inches of soil. They prefer soil that retains lots of moisture. Adults don't really require woody pulp in their soil, but it needs to be something they can easily dig into. Wouldn't recommend any average store bought soil. I personally use old compost mixed with locally found soil. The best type of soil for this is any that's loamy with minimal clay and sand, though they really don't seem to be very picky. Loamy soils retain the most water and are very easily for beetles to dig in. I'm sure there's some specialty type of soil you can buy from pet stores, but these beetles will gladly take the soil found literally right next to their habitat.

## Moisture
Keep it muddy and wet. Remember, they live in rotting wood, something known to get extremely wet and retain moisture. I've personally taken the container and filled it with water from a hose if it ever got too dry. The beetle literally thrives in wet soils and wood, so straight up mud won't hurt them at all. They shouldn't drown or get stuck in the muddy soil, but make sure you're not creating a literal mud puddle either, that WILL drown them.

## Ventilation
Obviously we want the beetle to breathe. They can't squeeze through anything smaller than them, so you can put decent sized holes here, but obviously you want to keep it smaller than a US dime so water and dirt doesn't go spilling out the enclosure. 2.5mm holes are plenty large enough. Make sure to have some venilation for the substrate too! While the larvae do eat fungi, it's probably best you don't encourage the growth of fungi in the container.

## Temperature
They hate cold weather, so anything near room temperature is perfect. They live in warm climates, so heat shouldn't hurt them so long as they have deep substrate, but they don't require it unless you live in some extremely cold climate with no climate control indoors. Just make sure it never gets dry inside the enclosure, they need high humidity and moisture.

## Hiding places
Not required since they tend to dig and hide in the soil, but I imagine they don't mind above ground hiding spots at all. If you have a large enclosure, feel free to add some rotting wood or other objects for them to hide in. While they are incredibly strong beetles, I'd steer clear of anything that's heavy.
